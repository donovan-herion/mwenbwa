This Game-Website is the first full stack JS project that I've done.

-   Start playing after having registered through a _User Authentification System_

-   Buy a maximum of trees and become the wealthiest person in Liege

-   Lock a maximum of trees to prevent potential robbery from other players

-   Check the ranking and gamelog to see how the game is evolving

-   Leave comments on your favorite trees
